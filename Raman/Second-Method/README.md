This is the newest iteration of the code to calculate the Raman spectrum of a molecule using dft results from CP2K.
This project looks at the spectrum for the Pyridine molecule.

There should be directories within of the form POL-[]-PROP-[]. POL-X-PROP-Y means that incident light is polarized in the X direction and propagates in the Y direction. Directories with all combinations of X,Y,Z are required for the spectrum except instances where the polarization and propagation are in the same direction. This means there should be a total of 6 directories.

For each directory above, there should be two directories (PLUS, MINUS) within for each vibrational mode of the molecule. Included in the POL-X-PROP-Y directory should be a directory of the form PYRIDINE-[]-MODE-[]. 

EX: The PYRIDINE-MINUS-MODE-01 directory. This means that the vibrational mode is subtracted (MINUS) from the positions of the atoms in the lowest energy structure of the molecule. There is both a minus and a plus directory for each mode because for each mode, derivatives need to be calculated and I chose the central difference derivative for higher accuracy. 

Necessary files for CP2K to be placed in the PYRIDINE-[]-MODE-[] directories:

  The geoopt-submit file is the submit script to be edited depending on your cluster specifications. This can be found in the PYRIDINE-[]-MODE-[] directories.
  
  The GEO-OPT.inp file is the dft input file for CP2K. An example is provided with the proper parameters for POL-X-PROP-Y. The incident light needs to be changed
  depending on the POL and the PROP. 
  
  The BASIS_SET file is required in order to tell CP2K how to build your wavefunctions. These can be found online.
  
  The pyridine.xyz file is required to give the initial atomic positions for the CP2K DFT code. The positions need to be changed based on the mode and the             addition/subtraction of said mode. EX: PYRIDINE-MINUS-MODE-01 means that pyridine.xyz needs the 1st mode subtracted from it.

Necessary files for CP2K to be placed in the POL-[]-PROP-[] directories:
   
   PYRIDINE-VIBRATIONS-1.mol which is the vibrational mode data generated by CP2K.
   
   Displace-Along-Modes.py reads in the vibrational mode data and changes the input positions (pyridine.xyz) depending on the mode. This reads in MODE-DATA which
   can be created by the command:
   
       grep -A 11 vibration PYRIDINE-VIBRATIONS-1.mol | grep -v "vibration\|--" > MODE-DATA
       
       11 here is the number of atoms in the molecule.

   RUN-ALL.sh should be edited based on what you want to change across all input files in the POL-[]-PROP-[] directories. It should then be copied to all of the        POL-[]-PROP-[] directories and ran to submit to the edge cluster. To copy and run one simply needs to type: 

      for d in */; do cp RUN-ALL.sh $d; cd $d; ./RUN-ALL.sh; cd ..; done  

   Once your jobs complete, run the ./CALC-RAMAN-AT-COM.sh command. This goes through and takes the electric fields and dipole moments and fourier transforms 
   them into frequency space, then reads in the vibrational modes (To be calculated with the VIBRATIONAL_ANALYSIS routine in CP2K), and returns the Raman              intensities for each mode and each pol-[]-prop-[], then it averages over the pol-[]-prop-[] results to get a Raman spectrum.
   
 Mathematical formulae:
 
 The polarizability is determined from the electric field components, the dipole moment components, and a "gamma factor" which gives a lifetime to electronic transitions.

In order to calculate the Raman intensiry, you need the isotropic and anisotropic polarizability derivatives:

 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha_p=\frac{1}{3}\bigg(\frac{\partial\alpha_{ii}}{\partial p}%2B\frac{\partial\alpha_{jj}}{\partial p}%2B\frac{\partial\alpha_{kk}}{\partial p}\bigg)">
 
 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\begin{array}{r} r_{\mathrm{p}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\left|\frac{\partial \alpha_{i i}}{\partial p}-\frac{\partial \alpha_{j j}}{\partial p}\right|^{2}%2B\left|\frac{\partial \alpha_{i i}}{\partial p}-\frac{\partial \alpha_{k k}}{\partial p}\right|^{2}%2B\mid \frac{\partial \alpha_{j j}}{\partial p}-\right. \\ \left.\left.\frac{\partial \alpha_{k k}}{\partial p}\right|^{2}%2B6\left(\left|\frac{\partial \alpha_{i i}}{\partial p}\right|^{2}%2B\left|\frac{\partial \alpha_{j j}}{\partial p}\right|^{2}%2B\left|\frac{\partial \alpha_{k k}}{\partial p}\right|^{2}\right)\right)\end{array}">
 
The Raman intensity of a mode is then:

 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d} \Omega}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0}^{2}}\left(\tilde{v}_{\mathrm{in}}-\tilde{v}_{\mathrm{p}}\right)^{4} \frac{h}{8 \pi^{2} c \tilde{v}_{\mathrm{p}}}\left(\frac{45\left|\alpha_{\mathrm{P}}\right|^{2}+7 \gamma_{\mathrm{P}}^{2}}{45}\right) \frac{1}{1-\mathrm{e}^{-h c \tilde{v}_{\mathrm{p}} / k_{\mathrm{b}} T}}">
